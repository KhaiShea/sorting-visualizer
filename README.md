# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

A web-based tool to visualize various sorting algorithms in action. This project allows users to shuffle an array, select a sorting algorithm, and watch the sorting process step by step with visual and audio feedback.

## Sorting Algorithms Explained

### 1. **Bubble Sort**
- **Time Complexity**: O(n¬≤)
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
- Repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

### 2. **Insertion Sort**
- **Time Complexity**: O(n¬≤)
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
- Builds the sorted array one element at a time by inserting elements into their correct position.

### 3. **Selection Sort**
- **Time Complexity**: O(n¬≤)
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
- Selects the smallest element from the unsorted part and swaps it with the first unsorted element.

### 4. **Merge Sort**
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n)
- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
- Divides the array into halves, sorts each half, and merges them back together.

### 5. **Quick Sort**
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n)
- **Space Complexity**: O(log n)
- Selects a pivot element and partitions the array into elements less than and greater than the pivot, then recursively sorts the partitions.

### 6. **Heap Sort**
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n)
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
- Builds a max heap and repeatedly extracts the largest element to sort the array.

### 7. **Counting Sort**
- **Time Complexity**: O(n + k)
- **Space Complexity**: O(k)
- Counts the occurrences of each element and uses this information to place elements in sorted order.

### 8. **Radix Sort**
- **Time Complexity**: O(nk)
- **Space Complexity**: O(n + k)
- Sorts numbers digit by digit, starting from the least significant digit.

### 9. **Bucket Sort**
- **Time Complexity**: O(n + k)
- **Space Complexity**: O(n + k)
- Distributes elements into buckets, sorts each bucket, and concatenates them.

### 10. **Shell Sort**
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log¬≤ n)
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
- Sorts elements at specific intervals, reducing the interval with each pass.

### 11. **Cocktail Shaker Sort**
- **Time Complexity**: O(n¬≤)
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
- A variation of Bubble Sort that sorts in both directions.

### 12. **Comb Sort**
- **Time Complexity**: O(n¬≤)
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
- Improves Bubble Sort by using a gap to compare elements.

### 13. **Bogo Sort**
- **Time Complexity**: O((n+1)!)
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
- Randomly shuffles the array until it is sorted.
